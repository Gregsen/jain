#Jain
Jain is a simple java installer for Ubuntu. It provides a minimalistic GUI to
make installing easier.

##Usage
Just run:
    chmod +x jain.sh
to make it executable and run it via
    ./jain.sh
Jain will ask for an URL to download Java from.
If no URL is provided, it will download Java 7u45 as default from the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).

##TODO
There is no proper error handling when verifying the downloaded archive.
